Customer Service Chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This repository hosts a smart customer service chatbot designed to enhance user experience by providing instant, accurate, and contextually relevant responses to customer queries about products. The chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful technique that combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative AI models.

Instead of relying solely on a fixed knowledge base, the chatbot dynamically retrieves the most relevant product-related documents or data, and then uses a language model to generate human-like answers. This approach allows it to handle a wide variety of customer inquiries with improved accuracy and understanding, even for complex or previously unseen questions.

Key Features:

Natural language understanding for seamless customer interaction

Retrieval of product data from an internal knowledge base or external sources

Generative AI response construction using the retrieved context

Scalable and adaptable for different types of products and services

This chatbot can be integrated into websites, apps, or support systems to help reduce workload on human agents and provide 24/7 support to customers.
